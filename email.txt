As Salamu Alaikum. A Curriculum Design and Review Committee meeting has been scheduled on this Saturday (September 10, 2018) commencing from 10:30 AM. You are cordially requested to attend the meeting. The agenda of the said meeting is to review the updated curriculum of BSEEE program for existing students, the revised curriculum for newcomers (students admitted from Fall 2018 trimester and onwards) and the proposed curriculum of MSEEE. Please, find all these curricula in the attachment. 
For your convenience, I would like to mention that the BSEEE curricula contain a summary of the proposed update. The file named “Curriculum_BSc_new.pdf” includes this summary in pages 23-31 and the file named “Curriculum_BSc_Existing.pdf” contains the same in pages 20-24. Both these files describe an “Introduction”, a “List of courses” and “Sequence of Courses” in the earlier pages and details the updated course content in the later pages. I hope this will help you review the entire files quickly. 
The venue of the meeting will be notified shortly. 
Best regards.
